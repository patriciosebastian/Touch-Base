Touch Base is a full stack React contacts management app. It uses React Router for front-end navigation, Node.js and Express on the back-end for its API, and a PostgresQL database. It features a fully responsive design, full CRUD capabilities for contacts and groups, Firebase Auth, and SendGrid for email functionality. AWS s3 is used for image hosting, and a demo login lets you easily tour the app and safely perform all actions.

New Feature Added: You can now import contacts from a .CSV file!
